## 🌼 How the Compliment Generator Was Created

The idea behind this project was to create something **wholesome**, **motivating**, and visually fun. Here’s a breakdown of how it was made:

### 🛠️ 1. Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Audio (MP3 background and typing effects)  
- Custom fonts: **Press Start 2P** 

📁 **Folder Structure**
```
compliment-generator/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── sounds/
│   ├── background-music.mp3
│   └── typewriter.mp3
├── images/
│   └── Background.jpg
└── README.md
```

### 🎨 2. Visual Design

- **Pastel Theme**: Soft pink background with tulips, clouds, and sakura petals, creating a dreamy mood.
- **Background**: A fixed soft image for a relaxing vibe.
- **Floating Flowers**: Created using CSS animations to simulate petals floating across the screen, giving a calm, whimsical effect.

### 🧠 3. Compliment Logic

- A **JavaScript array** holds dozens of kind, warm and supportive compliments.
- On button click, one compliment is picked at random.
- Compliment appears inside a paragraph element with a typing sound for emotional effect.

### 🔊 4. Audio Integration

- **Typing sound**: Plays once for each compliment.
- **Background music**: Looped calm tune, toggleable via a floating music button.

### 🖱️ 5. Interaction

- **Generate Button**: Starts the compliment display.
- **Music Toggle**: Lets users turn music on or off for more control over the ambiance.
